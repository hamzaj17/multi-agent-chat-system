User: Compare CNNs and RNNs and recommend one

[Coordinator] Received query: Compare CNNs and RNNs and recommend one

System:
Analysis Summary:
- CNNs are effective for spatial data such as images
- RNNs are suitable for sequential and temporal data

Key Trade-Offs:
- CNNs offer faster training due to parallelism
- RNNs handle sequence dependency but are slower

Recommendation:
CNNs are recommended for image-based tasks, while RNNs are better for sequence-based problems.
